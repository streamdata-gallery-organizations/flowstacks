description: Our mission is to empower developers with a new type of technology that
  allows them to focus on features instead of battling the technical challenges and
  understanding of a back end. We believe this ability to seamlessly manage resources
  will give developers an opportunity to compete with the major software service companies
  with extensive budgets.
